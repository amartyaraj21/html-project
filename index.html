<p>coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps; raw coffee beans must be roasted, the roasted coffee beans must then be ground, the <a href="coffee_grinding.html">ground</a> must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (<a href="brewing.html">brew</a>), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.

Coffee is usually brewed immediately before <a href="drink.html">drinking</a> . In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already roasted, or already <a href="Coffee_Roasting.html">roasted</a> and ground. Coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.
